## Quick start

```bash
# Recommend + install + serve the best model for your project
npx osaikit run local --repo .

# Analyze a remote GitHub repo (no install)
npx osaikit --repo https://github.com/user/repo

# Refresh leaderboard data from 5 live sources
npx osaikit refresh

# Interactive wizard
npx osaikit
```

## `run local` — one command to a running model

Analyzes your repo, picks the best open-source LLM, installs it via [Ollama](https://ollama.com), and verifies the API is serving.

```bash
osaikit run local --repo .                    # auto-detect → deploy
osaikit run local --model qwen3-8b            # specific model
osaikit run local --model devstral-small-2    # SOTA coding model
osaikit run local                             # general-purpose defaults
```

What it does:
1. Scans your codebase (languages, frameworks, project size)
2. Scores 52 models across 7 dimensions and picks the best fit
3. Ensures Ollama is installed and running
4. Pulls the model
5. Verifies the API at `http://localhost:11434/v1`

Requires [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download) installed locally.

## Recommend mode

Scores 52 open-source models across seven weighted dimensions to find the best fit for your project. Two modes:

### `--repo <path>` — Auto-detect mode

Point at any local repo or remote GitHub URL. The analyzer scans your codebase and auto-detects languages, frameworks, runtime, platform, and project size — then skips straight to recommendations.

```bash
osaikit --repo .
osaikit --repo ~/projects/my-api
osaikit --repo https://github.com/user/repo   # clones + analyzes remotely
```

### Interactive wizard

Answer six quick questions about your development environment:

1. **Role** — web, backend, mobile, or game development
2. **Tech stack** — languages, frameworks, runtime, platform
3. **Constraints** — memory limit, budget, deployment mode, privacy
4. **Use cases** — code generation, debugging, architecture, review, docs, testing
5. **License** — permissive, copyleft, or any
6. **Context** — codebase size and whether it's an existing project

### What you get

- **Primary recommendation** with score breakdown across 7 dimensions
- **Quick start commands** — copy-paste `ollama run`, vLLM Docker, llama.cpp, HuggingFace TGI, or LM Studio setup
- **License guidance** — commercial use, fine-tuning rights, output ownership, training data provenance, and action items
- **Integration snippet** — framework-specific code to wire the model into your stack (Express, FastAPI, Gin, Axum, etc.)
- **Fallback model** from a different family
- **On-device option** for local/offline use
- **Enterprise readiness score** — managed hosting providers, SLA availability, SDK quality, community size
- Tuned inference config (temperature, top-p, max tokens)
- Starter prompt template for your use case
- Cost and latency estimates (local vs. cloud)
- RAG recommendation when your context exceeds the model's window
- Warnings about license, age, memory, and latency tradeoffs

## Install

```bash
npx osaikit
```

Or install globally:

```bash
npm install -g osaikit
osaikit
```

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/patio-coop/osaikit.git
cd osaikit
npm install
npm run dev    # build + run
npm test       # run tests
```

## How scoring works

Models are first filtered by hard constraints (license, RAM, privacy, budget, deployment). Remaining candidates are scored across seven dimensions:

| Dimension | Weight | What it measures |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| Capability fit | 3.0x | Strength/weakness match to your role and use cases |
| Context match | 2.0x | Context window vs. your codebase size needs |
| Benchmarks | 2.0x | HumanEval, SWE-bench, Aider polyglot, LiveCodeBench, BigCodeBench |
| Compute footprint | 1.5x | Latency, on-device viability, budget fit |
| Ecosystem | 1.0x | Tooling support (Ollama, llama.cpp, vLLM, etc.) |
| Enterprise readiness | 0.75x | Managed hosting, SLA, VPC, SDK quality, community, docs |
| Fine-tuning | 0.5x | LoRA/adapter support, fine-tunability |

Live leaderboard data from five sources (HuggingFace, SWE-bench Verified, Aider Polyglot, LiveCodeBench, and BigCodeBench) is fetched in parallel to enrich results — but the tool works fully offline using its built-in model database. Run `osaikit refresh` to force-update leaderboard data.

## Roadmap — from recommendation CLI to open-source AI distro

osaikit today recommends the right model and tells you how to set it up. The goal is to evolve it into an opinionated distribution of the open-source AI stack — one that provisions the full deployment, not just the model.

The open-source AI stack has all the components but none of the packaging. Models are competitive (3 months behind closed frontier, closing fast), ML frameworks are production-grade, and inference engines like vLLM are battle-tested. But everything around the model — compliance, observability, safety, developer experience — scores 2 out of 5 on enterprise readiness. The gap isn't capability. It's the wrapper.

osaikit closes that gap the way a Linux distro closes the gap between the kernel and a working desktop: opinionated defaults, everything wired together, profiles for different needs.

### What's built

### What's next — the distro gap

The shift from "recommend" to "provision." Each row below has an open-source component that works — osaikit needs to wire it in.

| Layer | Enterprise readiness gap | Component to wire | Work |
|---|---|---|---|

| MCP tooling | 2/5 | [mcpd](https://github.com/mozilla-ai/mcpd) | Declarative MCP server management — lifecycle, secret injection, dev-to-prod config; powers `osaikit agent` tool-calling setup |
| Shared agent learning | — | [cq](https://github.com/mozilla-ai/cq) | Collective knowledge for agents — persist and share solutions across sessions so agents stop rediscovering failures; future `osaikit agent` enhancement |
| Quantization | 2/5 | GGUF, AWQ, GPTQ via Ollama/llama.cpp | Auto-select quantization for available hardware |
| Federated inference | — | Mesh routing to community GPU nodes | Future: `osaikit run federated` as a backend option |

### Profiles

Different stacks for different needs, all provisioned with one command:

```bash
osaikit init --profile local-dev      # Ollama + model + basic safety
osaikit init --profile startup        # vLLM + monitoring + compliance report
osaikit init --profile enterprise     # Full stack: safety rails, audit logging,
                                      # content filtering, compliance docs
osaikit init --profile research       # Eval harness + fine-tuning tools
osaikit init --profile agent          # Agent framework + tool-calling config
```

### Context

This roadmap is informed by the [OSAI gap map](https://substack.com/home/post/p-193802654) — a scoring of 42 subcategories of the open-source AI stack against closed-source equivalents. The models aren't the problem. Enterprise readiness averages 2.3 out of 5. Terms of Service scored 1. The packaging gap is a "years" problem, and almost all the energy in the ecosystem is going to the part (models) that's already closest to parity.

osaikit focuses on the other part.

## Development

```bash
# Build + run with local changes
npm run dev

# Build + run with --repo flag (local path or remote URL)
